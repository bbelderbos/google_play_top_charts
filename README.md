# What Android apps are crushing it on Google Play?

Repo for [this blog post](http://bobbelderbos.com/2016/07/google-play-topapps/) in which I use 42matters Google Play Top Charts API to analyze top app charts on Google Play. I zoom in on categories and compare Spain with US. What are the top (new) free, (new) paid and grossing categories? And what app categories are trending right now? Lastly I check Pokemon Go's success by using the Google Play App Rank History API
